Travelling between cities


You are given positions of  cities situated on X axis. The position of the  city is denoted by array value .You have a bike which can travel exactly  unit distance once the tank is full and each city has a fuel pump. Now you have to answer  queries where each query is of the following form.

 :- Find the number of cities lying in the index range  that you can reach from the city at index .
Constraints:

Note :- Use fast i/o.



Format of the input file:
First line :  i.e Number of testcases.
For each testcase :
First line : Three space separated integers  ,  and .
Second line :  space separated integers denoting the location of cities .
Next  lines : Three space separated  integers denoting the query.

Format of the output file:
Output the answer to each query in a separate line.

Sample Input
1
5 2 2
4 3 1 9 6
1 3 5 
1 5 2
Sample Output
3 
4
Explanation
For second query you can reach all the cities from city with location 3(index 2) except the city with location 9(index 4).

Note: Your code should be able to convert the sample input into the sample output. However, this is not enough to pass the challenge, because the code will be run on multiple test cases. Therefore, your code must solve this problem statement.
